This project classifies German traffic signs using two different models: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

1. CNN Model (CNN.ipynb)

Uses TensorFlow and Keras.
Input images are resized to 30x30 RGB format.
Labels are one-hot encoded.
The model is trained using multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers.
To run the CNN model:
Hit run all at the top of the notebook

Note: TensorFlow can sometimes be unstable on certain systems, especially if GPU support isn't configured properly. If there are errors, try running it with CPU only by setting:

2. SVM Model (SVM.ipynb)

Uses Scikit-learn’s SVC with a linear kernel.
Images are flattened and normalized before training.
To run the SVM model:

Hit run all at the top of the notebook

3. Folder Structure Assumption:

The code reads in the CSV files assuming the following structure, and prints out to a CSV located in test/. The training and test folders must exist in the directory before running, so that they can be read from and written to.

train/train_metadata.csv — CSV with image paths and labels for training.
train/ — Folder with training images.
test/ and test/test_metadata.csv — Optional, used for generating test predictions.
Dependencies:
Install using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
