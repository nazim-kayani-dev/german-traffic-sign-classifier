# German Traffic Sign Classifier

This project builds and evaluates two machine learning models for classifying German traffic signs:
1.  A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow and Keras.
2.  A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** built with Scikit-learn.

## Models & Techniques

* **CNN Model (`CNN.ipynb`):** A deep learning model featuring multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers to automatically learn features from the sign images.
* **SVM Model (`SVM.ipynb`):** A traditional machine learning model using a linear kernel. Images are flattened and normalized to create a feature vector for classification.

## Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow & Keras
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Data Source

This model is trained on the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset**.

**[IMPORTANT]**: The `train/` and `test/` image folders are required to run this project but are not included in this repository.

You can download the dataset from the official source on Kaggle.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Download the GTSRB dataset and place the `Train` and `Test` folders inside the `train/` and `test/` directories, respectively, as expected by the code.
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
4.  Open either `CNN.ipynb` or `SVM.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and "Run All" cells.

## Prediction Outputs

This repository includes the prediction CSV files generated by both models:
* `CNNPredictions.csv`
* `SVMPredictions.csv`
